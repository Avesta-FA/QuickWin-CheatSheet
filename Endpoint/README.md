### Stacking
Generally endpoints tend to be very similar especially if you have baseline configuration. When you gather data from your endpoints  (e.g Registry) you can perform what is called stacking.  
When you stack the specified data from all the endpoints you will end up with entries that only exist on a small number of endpoints. Those entries are the ones you want to analyze.  
A great tool that utilizes this technique is called [Kansa](https://github.com/davehull/Kansa/) by dave hull.
